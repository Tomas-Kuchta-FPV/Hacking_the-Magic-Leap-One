## The motivation:
I don't like to see cool tech ending in landfills. Because it isn't great for the environment. So I've started this project. To bring the AR glasses back to life. I thought of three ways to extend the life of this product.

## I never done this
I'm still learning. So any help would be appreciated. I love learning and this is a huge opportunity for me.

## Ways of doing it
I thought of three ways to do this.
Please contribute if there is an even better way.

 1. Dumping the MLOS and patching it
 2. Or reverse engineering the cloud authentification handshake
 3. Maybe even reverse engineering the board and making a custom bootloader with a custom OS
    - Going to be probably so hard
