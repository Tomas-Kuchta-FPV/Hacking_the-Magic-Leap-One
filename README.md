# hacking_the-Magic-Leap-one

## The motivation:
I don't like to see cool tech ending in lanfils. Because it isn't great for the enviroment. So I've started this project. To bring the AR glasses back to life. I thought of three ways to extend the life of this product.

## I never done this
I'm still learning. So any help would be apriciated. I absolutly love learning and this is a huge oportunity for me.

## Ways of doing it
I thought of three ways to do this.
Please contribute if you think there is even better way.

 1. Dumping the MLOS and patching it
 2. Or revese ingeneering the cloud authentification hanshake
 3. Maybe even revese ingeneering the board and making a custom bootloader with custom OS
    - Going to be probably so hard
